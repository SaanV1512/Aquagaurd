# Assumptions

- Water consumption data is available as periodic smart-meter readings.
- Explicit labels for leak events are not available.
- Analysis is performed at a regional or zone level.
- The system provides early warnings, not precise leak localization.
- Final decisions and inspections remain human-driven.
