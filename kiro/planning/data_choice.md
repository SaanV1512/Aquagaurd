# Data Choice

We use a publicly available water consumption forecasting dataset containing regional consumption records over time.

The dataset reflects real-world constraints where utilities often lack explicit leak annotations and rely primarily on consumption logs. This motivates an anomaly-based early-warning approach rather than supervised leak detection.

The dataset provides sufficient temporal coverage and natural seasonality for demand modeling and abnormal consumption analysis.
