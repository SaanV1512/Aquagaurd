# Problem Statement

Urban water utilities lose significant amounts of treated water due to abnormal consumption caused by pipe leakages, bursts, and operational inefficiencies. These issues are often identified only after large volumes of water have already been wasted.

A key challenge is that utilities primarily rely on periodic smart-meter readings, and explicit ground-truth labels for leak events are rarely available. Continuous physical monitoring of all pipe segments is costly and impractical.

This creates a need for a scalable, data-driven early-warning system that can monitor consumption behavior and highlight abnormal usage patterns so that inspection and maintenance efforts can be prioritized effectively.
